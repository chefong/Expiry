# Expiry

Expiry is a React application for Mercedes-Benz R&D's Design Challenge. The goal was to create a web application that manages a fleet of couriers and loads in "real-time" via an inputted CSV file. More specifically, the user would need to be able to keep track of any overloads that may occur within any of the couriers from merging with one another.

## Setup
To run Expiry locally, run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Navigate to localhost:3000 on a browser (if a browser window did not automatically open). This is what you should see.
